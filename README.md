### Abstract:

E-Commerce has emerged to become one of the biggest industries with a tremen- dous shift from offline shopping to online shopping. This trend is seeing an expo- nential rise and more and more people prefer online shopping for factors such as convenience and discounted.To begin, the reviews were converted into vector repre- sentations using a variety of techniques, including bag-of-words, Tf-Idf, and glove. After that, we trained several machine learning algorithms, including logistic re- gression, random forest, nave bias, Support Vector Machine, and bert.This project presents a comparison of multiple machine learning models for doing sentiment analysis on Amazon product evaluations in the Electronics sector. Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, BERT, Stochastic Gra- dient Descent (SVM Linear), and Linear SVM models are the key models we will investigate for our investigation.The models were then assessed using accuracy, f1- score, precision, and the cross-entropy loss function.
